## General Description
***
C195 (Software II) is a scheduling software that pulls from a mySQL database. In the database there are multiple tables: Appointments, Contacts, Countries, Customers, First Level Divisions, and Users.
Each of these tables has unique information about the appointment, who the appointment is for, and who to contact for the appointment. The user table has information about who can log in and access the scheduler.
Using the application all of these tables work together in order to create customers, schedule appointments and view reports about both the customers and appointments.
